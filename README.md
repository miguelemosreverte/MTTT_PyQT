# MTTT: Translators' Training Tool
## PyQT-based version


## Machine translation made easy for human translators!
TTT is an under development post-editing suite which aims to improve the translators experience with machine translation tools such as moses. It provides the user with a graphical user interface to:

- Work with the moses machine translation pipeline.
- Apply evaluation metrics such as BLEU.
- Post-edit the obtained machine translation.



### Features
- Portable (Windows / Linux)
- Friendly Graphical User Interface (GUI) for MOSES.
- Use machine translation tool MOSES, post-edit the output and run evaluation metrics.

- Versions: 
GTK-based https://github.com/roxana-lafuente/MTTT
Web POC: https://github.com/miguelemosreverte/TTT_web

### Dependencies
Tested on: Ubuntu 16.04 LTS, Qt version '4.8.7', SIP version '4.17', PyQt version: '4.11.4'

#### Source code

##### About Linux
- You should link /bin/sh to /bin/bash and not to bin dash. To do that:
	- Check the link:
	```
	ls -l /bin/sh
	```
	- If /bin/sh is a link to /bin/dash, change it to /bin/bash.
	```
	sudo mv /bin/sh /bin/sh.orig
	sudo ln -s /bin/bash /bin/sh
	```
This is necessary to use the redirection commands used by MOSES commands.


##### On Ubuntu
- MOSES (Install with "--with-mm" and "--install-scripts" flags)
- To install its dependencies run

	```
	python ubuntu_install.py
	```

##### On Windows using Cygwin
- MOSES (Install with "--with-mm" and "--install-scripts" flags)
- To install Cygwin and its dependencies run

	```
	python cygwin_install.py
	```
##### Options for Windows
- MOSES (Install with "--with-mm" and "--install-scripts" flags)
- the following installer is recommended:
	[https://sourceforge.net/projects/pygobjectwin32/files/pygi-aio-3.18.2_rev10-setup_84c21bc2679ff32e73de38cbaa6ef6d30c628ae5.exe/download](https://sourceforge.net/projects/pygobjectwin32/files/pygi-aio-3.18.2_rev10-setup_84c21bc2679ff32e73de38cbaa6ef6d30c628ae5.exe/download)

- use binary distribution of Moses	
	
### Status
- Under development. Currently everything is working but we need a better GUI design and add robustness (strict error handling).



### How to use

#### Source code

##### On Linux
Simply install all dependencies and run:
```
python main.py
